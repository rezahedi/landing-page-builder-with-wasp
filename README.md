# Landing Page Builder with Wasp

I'm going to try [Wasp](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) and build a landing page builder service with a drag n drop editor like [Craft.js](https://github.com/prevwong/craft.js) to see how it works.

Wasp is a new tool to building full-stack modern web applications, It takes care of all three major parts of a web application: client (front-end), server (back-end) and database by using React, Node.js and Prisma under the hood.

At the core is the Wasp compiler which takes the Wasp config and your Javascript code and outputs the client app, server app and deployment code.
